# ðŸ“Œ Python Async Programming Project

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project explores asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. It demonstrates how to write non-blocking code with `async`/`await`, execute coroutine-based workflows, create tasks for concurrency, and harness the `random` module to simulate unpredictable delays and outcomes.

Whether you're building a scalable backend system, running timed simulations, or learning modern Python concurrency patterns â€” this project gives you a strong foundation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, youâ€™ll be able to confidently:

- âœ… Understand and use `async` and `await` syntax to define and run coroutines.
- âœ… Execute asynchronous Python programs using the `asyncio` event loop.
- âœ… Launch and run **concurrent coroutines** for parallel-like behavior.
- âœ… Create and manage **asyncio tasks** to schedule work independently.
- âœ… Utilize the `random` module to simulate variability in async workflows (e.g., random delays, randomized outcomes).

## ðŸ“¦ Modules Used

- `asyncio`: Python's standard asynchronous I/O framework
- `random`: Used to simulate randomness and delay durations

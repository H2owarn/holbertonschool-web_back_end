# 📚 REST API Pagination Project

This project explores multiple strategies for paginating datasets in RESTful APIs, including simple pagination, hypermedia-driven pagination (HATEOAS), and deletion-resilient pagination. It is designed to deepen your understanding of scalable API design and improve user experience when navigating large datasets.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain:

- ✅ How to paginate a dataset using basic `page` and `page_size` parameters
- ✅ How to implement pagination with hypermedia metadata (HATEOAS)
- ✅ How to design pagination that is resilient to deletions in the dataset

---


## 🛠️ Requirements

- ✅ All files are interpreted with **Python 3.9** on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- ✅ Each file starts with: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- ✅ All files end with a newline
- ✅ Code follows **pycodestyle** (version 2.5.\*)
- ✅ File lengths are validated using `wc`
- ✅ All modules and functions include **meaningful documentation**
- ✅ All functions and coroutines are **type-annotated**
